# Logo assets

Place your logo image files in this **public** folder so they are served at the site root:

- **logo-main.png** – main logo (navbar, admin header, admin login, favicon)
- **logo-sec.png** – secondary logo (footer on main site and events page)

They will be available as `/logo-main.png` and `/logo-sec.png`.

If the files are missing, the app shows a "G" + "GATEWAV" text fallback automatically.
